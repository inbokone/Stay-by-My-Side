Sorry.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.760
I'm so sorry. Which department are you from?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.442
Let's go.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:16.512
Sorry.

Sorry about that.

always unsteady.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.325
So if gravity brings

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:35.228
Newton and the apple together,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.365
we should study it carefully,

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.536
or just take a bite and eat it.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.506
Are you immune enough?

Pretend to be fearless.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:49.709
Going forward, go, go, go.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.530
Unfortunately, you're hit by a dart.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.816
You still need to find a way
to get the antidote.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.119
If you want the antidote,

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:04.190
better to rely on yourself and charge forward.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.292
If you're lucky enough to be hit by the dart,

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:09.796
treat it as an experience
to strengthen your immunity.

Hi, Junior.

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.133
I heard you were good at basketball
in high school.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.935
Why don't you join the basketball team?

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.170
Not interested.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.305
Jiang, I heard you transferred
from the medical school,

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.740
making the dean very regretful.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.442
Your dad even called to check,

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.510
thinking you might have been wronged.

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:07.947
Since you're in law school now,

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:10.016
we should invite your parents to dinner.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.684
No need. You're not familiar.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.054
You can study here with ease.

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.690

when I was growing up.

half of this room is mine.

Are you sure you want to stay in this room?

Starting today, this is my room too.

Are you sure you want to live here?

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:07.353
This place is really haunted.

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:10.223
Look at this bed and that bed.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:12.792
No one lives here because of the haunting.

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.061
The dorm supervisor said they're
occupying the beds while living off-campus,

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.229
a bad example.

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:21.767
Is there anything else
I should know that I don't?

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.672
The dorm supervisor wouldn't dare
tell you this place is really haunted.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.208
Then why do you still dare to live here?

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:33.145

Come, let me tell you.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.385
There was a student here.

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.487
He used to be bullied all the time,

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:44.357
and he could only hide in the dorm
and cry by himself.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.826
One day, he cried himself to sleep.

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:47.994
And then,

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:50.930
he was electrocuted and no one knew.

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.799
He wasn't discovered until several days later.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.536
The resentment here is really heavy.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.404
Are you sure you want to live here?

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.573
Hallucinations or environments

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:02.775
can cause mental confusion and misperception.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:06.345
Thinking you've seen a ghost
is just because you're timid.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:57.930
Why were you so fierce today?

00:09:58.798 --> 00:09:59.966
I'm annoyed.

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:02.301
Someone moved into my dorm room.

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:05.171
He wears and uses high-end stuff,

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.806
so why does he have to live with me

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:08.991
in a dorm without any private space?

00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:10.977
Why pretend to be poor?

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:12.345
What's there to be annoyed about?

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.046
It's not like a ghost moved in.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:15.114
You guys don't understand.

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.449
When I was young, my biggest hope

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.117
was to have a room all to myself.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.853
Please, how long have you monopolized
the three-person room?

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:22.021
Exactly.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.790
I even thought you might have asked your sister
to drive people away with magic.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.261
Good idea.

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:30.830
I can ask my sister to cast a spell

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.865
and drive away this rude person.

Is he going crazy?

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:47.113
Yeah, he's been like that lately.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.429
Know yourself and know your enemy,
and you will win every battle.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.693
He says he has no money,

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:09.962
yet he gives such an expensive helmet
to a girl.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.815

to travel on the same boat…

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.728
Right.

00:14:17.728 --> 00:14:20.125
I'll think of a way to make him move out soon.

which is to win a few games
in the college cup this year.

We can't go home empty-handed like last year.

No problem, just leave it to me.

It would be great to find someone
who can keep up with you.

Jiang Chi was a scoring guard
in his high school basketball team,

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:54.693
and everyone called him a sharpshooter.

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:57.429
No way. If he's in, I'm out.

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:59.265
I don't want to see him everywhere,

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:00.666
even when playing basketball.

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.501
This isn't the show "Wishing to See You".

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.105
Buxia.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.156
So annoying.

00:15:57.504 --> 00:16:01.984
♫ Go, going left, going right, and where to ♫

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.832
♫ This is the junction
most familiar to me every day ♫

00:16:08.832 --> 00:16:11.840
♫ The rhythm was disrupted by you ♫

00:16:13.632 --> 00:16:18.474
♫ The sky is sometimes clear,
sometimes cloudy, and sometimes rainy ♫

00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:24.800
♫ The wind and the sea come and go,
and I lost myself ♫

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.184
♫ I want to block my thoughts ♫

00:16:29.184 --> 00:16:34.560
♫ My vision has run wild
and my hearing is wrong ♫

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.348
♫ And I even laugh unconsciously ♫

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:46.112
♫ I block all messages from the world,
and you're the only frequency I receive ♫

00:16:47.969 --> 00:16:51.136
♫ How to unlock the clues? Where is the exit? ♫

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:55.479
♫ Whatever I do, you appear in my dreams ♫

00:16:55.479 --> 00:17:01.248
♫ This is love, and I ♫

00:17:01.248 --> 00:17:07.328
♫ Fell in love. You're the one I want
to hold hands and walk with, the one I desire ♫

00:17:07.328 --> 00:17:11.360
♫ I want you in every breath
and in every touching moment ♫

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.256
♫ Let's hold hands and walk in strides ♫

00:17:16.256 --> 00:17:19.705
♫ My chest is broad for you ♫

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:20.939
I'll go first.

00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:39.024
Give it to me.

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:40.926
No, I got it first.

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:07.119
It's all your fault.

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:08.821
Why did you fight with me for it?

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:40.285
Junior.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.321
One of you studies anthropology, the other law.

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:43.722
Fate brought you together in the same dorm.

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:45.257
Do you have to fight like this?

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.326
Senior.

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:49.895
He's the one picking fights, not me.

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:53.966
You're not elementary school students.

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.434
Can you act more maturely?

00:18:56.768 --> 00:18:59.505
One person's immaturity
makes it hard for the mature one.

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:01.874
All talk, no action.

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:10.749
How about this?

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:12.317
Let's have a manly contest.

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:13.385
Arm wrestling.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.755
The loser can't argue
with the winner for a month.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.767
The loser is a puppy.

00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:31.436
Get ready to be a dog.

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:35.541
The last time I did this was in middle school.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.752
Ready.

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:47.872
Go!

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.752
Go, Buxia, go!

00:19:52.096 --> 00:19:53.292
Gu Buxia, go!

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:55.060
Go, Buxia, go!

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.062
Go!

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.565
Go!

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:02.734
Jiang Chi, go!

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:04.136
Gu Buxia, go! Buxia, go!

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:05.404
Buxia, go!

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.739
Go, Buxia, go!

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:28.192
Gu Buxia, go!

00:20:28.192 --> 00:20:34.144
Jiang Chi, go! Jiang Chi.

00:20:34.656 --> 00:20:38.752
♫ You and I don't match. Get out of my way ♫

00:20:38.752 --> 00:20:42.368
♫ Just let me be silly for a moment ♫

00:20:42.368 --> 00:20:46.208
♫ Let me sleep peacefully at night ♫

00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:49.696
♫ Say hi halfway in the dream ♫

00:20:49.696 --> 00:20:53.888
♫ Oh, Mr. Alexander, we won't say bye loudly ♫

00:20:53.888 --> 00:20:56.960
♫ Just let me be silly for a moment ♫

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.640
♫ You behave and go play on the side ♫

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.256
♫ Make me too happy to talk ♫

00:21:04.256 --> 00:21:08.160
♫ Oh, Mr. Alexander, don't come back
after we break up ♫

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.192
♫ Mr. Alexander, Alexander ♫

00:21:12.192 --> 00:21:13.952
♫ Get out of my way ♫

00:21:24.672 --> 00:21:32.000
♫ Don't leave me stranded in a sea of people ♫

00:21:32.704 --> 00:21:36.928
♫ Crying for help on an island of memories ♫

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:40.661
♫ I don't want anyone to find out ♫

00:21:41.984 --> 00:21:44.704
♫ But just want you to hear me ♫

00:21:44.704 --> 00:21:46.880
♫ I miss you ♫

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.426
♫ Like a burning fire ♫

00:21:50.426 --> 00:21:53.888
♫ Breaking taboos and boundaries ♫

00:21:53.888 --> 00:21:57.920
♫ Spreading endlessly ♫

00:21:58.464 --> 00:22:02.464
♫ You hear that, don't you? ♫

00:22:02.464 --> 00:22:06.112
♫ I finally get it now♫

00:22:06.848 --> 00:22:12.448
♫ What I never said to you ♫

00:22:14.944 --> 00:22:18.912
♫ Answer me if you can hear me ♫

00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:22.496
♫ Okay? ♫

00:22:22.496 --> 00:22:24.512
[Stay by My Side]

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:27.612
The loser is a puppy.

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:29.792
If you're going to live with me,

00:22:29.792 --> 00:22:31.283
- You must eat this.
- I don't want to.

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.416
My potato chips.

00:22:32.416 --> 00:22:34.436
Gu Buxia, get off of me.

00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:36.421
Shouldn't dorm mates
take good care of each other?

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:39.491
I think I just had a nightmare.

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:41.312
You were yelling and making a ruckus outside
early in the morning.

00:22:41.824 --> 00:22:42.912
Are you okay?

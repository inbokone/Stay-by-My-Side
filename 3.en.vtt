Hello, Brother, what's wrong?

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.681
Sis, has the seal been broken?

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.016
Broken?

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.319
I had a fever after I came back yesterday.

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:23.387
And then today, I started to hear some strange noises whispering in my ears.

00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:26.626
Also, my protective amulet is broken.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:47.347
Buxia, did you say you can hear them now?

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.948
Just calm down first.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.751
Grandpa said whoever takes over the temple has to be responsible for it.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:55.352
We all know you're scared, so I volunteered to do it.

00:00:55.352 --> 00:00:57.624
I burned my talisman last night.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:00.660
Now, I can hear, see, and talk to them.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.629
And?

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.231
You burned yours, but mine's still sealed.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.101
Didn't Senior help strengthen my seal?

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.688
I burned my talisman to unseal it,

00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:14.571
- but...
- But what? Be more specific.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.012
I accidentally burned a tiny part of yours.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.613
Really just a little bit.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.415
I thought it wouldn't cause any major problems.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.750
Anyway, just hang in there for now.

Pretend like you're listening to ghost stories in a podcast.

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:30.289
At least you can only hear them and not see them right now.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.192
I will figure something out.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.126
Wait for me.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.799
I'm so cold.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.401
So cold.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:48.407
I want to redress my grievances. I want revenge.

Please don't let me see it.

Save me. There's a ghost.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.636
Why are you hiding here to scare me?

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.437
You're the ghost, aren't you?

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.239
Can you tell me your birth date and time?

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:03.776
It's okay if you don't want to say it.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:06.612
Just tell me how heavy your 'Eight Characters' are.

00:04:11.328 --> 00:04:15.285
Those sounds... Strange.

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:18.722
When I touched him, those sounds disappear.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:23.062
Why does it have to be him?

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.508
He must think I'm crazy.

I'd probably kick me out.

You said it gets cold when the ghost sounds appear,

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:52.055
but when you touched your roommate, the sounds disappeared and it got warm.

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:54.792
I've tried a few times, and it seems to be true.

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:56.696
How heavy are his 'Eight Characters'?

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:59.730
I asked him, but he just looked at me like I was crazy.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.202
You should try a few more times to see the effect.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:06.272
This makes me look like a pervert.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:09.907
All right. I'll find a chance to try again.

00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:12.512
Luckily, I only burned a corner of it.

As long as it's about the basketball team, you can ask me.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.820
It's a personal question.

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:28.757
I have a friend, who's always being harassed by someone in various ways.

00:15:28.757 --> 00:15:32.631
He finds all kinds of reasons to be around him,

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.333
often stares at him,

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:37.870
and even touches him intentionally or unintentionally.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.273
Didn't your friend fight him back?

00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:46.578
Then it's not harassment.

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:49.214
It should be considered

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:53.284

since the opponent forfeited, we're confirmed to advance.

Why don't we just forfeit, too?

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:09.230
It's all your fault.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.766
Your actions caused misunderstandings.

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.468
Even I, when I look at them…

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:14.969
What?

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:18.806
Look, it's like this.

00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:21.276
Should we explain?

00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:22.944
Explain what?

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:27.248
Or do you not want to make it public?

00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:33.722
I didn't expect we could
see a real-life love scene.

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:35.957
This is so exciting.

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:37.892
Sorry to interrupt.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.829
Hello, we're from the school newspaper.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.531
Since everyone is very curious about you two,

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:45.100
can we have an interview with you?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.801
- Sure.
- Not really.

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:51.873
There were rumors that you two
were not getting along.

00:00:51.873 --> 00:00:54.141
Is that true?

00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:55.535
Yes.

00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:58.446
Why?

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:00.681
Because he didn't want to live with others.

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:03.051
Then how did you two make up?

00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:06.220
You seem to get along
very well from the photos.

00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:11.459
I just saw the photos this morning.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:13.727
I realized our schoolmates

00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:15.930
are really good at taking photos.

00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:19.100
Sorry, I digressed.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.337
This is a good chance to clarify

00:01:22.337 --> 00:01:24.606
that our relationship is actually quite good.

00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:26.608
He might have a cold and serious face,

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:28.343
but actually, he's a good person.

00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:30.345
Although I was very annoyed with him at first,

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:31.780
later I found out

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.149
he was cold on the outside
but warm on the inside.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.151
Are you two dating?

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:43.391
We're just together.

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:51.733
We just live together.

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:54.069
Can you define a specific timing

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.838
of liking someone?

00:01:59.307 --> 00:02:00.809
For me,

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:03.211
there's no specific timing for liking someone.

00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:06.214
When you can't stop thinking about someone,

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:08.016
that's probably when you start to like him.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.428
Buxia, what about you?

00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:22.430
- I…
- Right.

00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:24.432
The reason why I joined the basketball team…

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:27.068
Was it for Buxia?

00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:35.143
Please cheer for the basketball team together.

00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:37.645
- So you two later…
- That's all the questions.

00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:38.746
I haven't finished yet.

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:39.914
Thank you. We'll leave now.

00:02:39.914 --> 00:02:41.749
I still have questions.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.952
Wait.

00:02:45.553 --> 00:02:47.789
Why did you say that?

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.158
Isn't it good to cheer for the basketball team?

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.160
No.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.529
It's the way you said it and that expression,

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:56.664
it will worsen misunderstandings.

00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:02.437
It's not a misunderstanding.

00:03:02.437 --> 00:03:04.506
I meant what I said.

00:15:17.304 --> 00:15:20.040
He kissed me, but why didn't I dodge?

00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:24.445
Why didn't you dodge when he kissed you?

00:15:24.445 --> 00:15:27.181
I thought I could absorb more energy to store.

00:15:27.181 --> 00:15:29.984
In case he suddenly disappears
for a long time like last time.

00:15:29.984 --> 00:15:31.819
But why did your heart beat faster?

00:15:31.819 --> 00:15:34.221
Your hand went up,
and even your mouth puckered up?

00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:36.590
As an ordinary person being kissed like that,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.225
you can't help but get involved, right?

00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:39.994
And if my heart didn't beat,

00:15:39.994 --> 00:15:41.629
I'd be dead.

00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:43.464
People are saying you're dating.

00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:44.999
Why don't you explain?

00:15:44.999 --> 00:15:46.800
He did explain.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.869
He said we're not dating,

00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:50.437
we're just together,

00:15:50.437 --> 00:15:51.906
living together.

00:15:52.506 --> 00:15:55.209
He's so busy, and he still takes care of you.

00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:56.744
He joined the basketball team for you.

00:15:56.744 --> 00:15:58.679
Don't you feel guilty?

00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.980
Why not just tell him directly

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.949
that you're afraid of hearing
the voice of the ghosts?

00:16:03.284 --> 00:16:05.219
I'm afraid he'll think I'm using him.

00:16:05.219 --> 00:16:07.588
What if he gets angry?

00:16:16.764 --> 00:16:18.198
Continue, dribbling between the legs.

00:16:18.198 --> 00:16:19.600
Morning.

00:16:20.701 --> 00:16:21.936
Later, we'll practice dribbling.

00:16:22.937 --> 00:16:25.439
I don't need to warm up.
I ran here this morning.

00:16:25.439 --> 00:16:26.640
Really?

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.211
Hey.

00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:33.380
Are you really with Jiang Chi?

00:16:34.715 --> 00:16:36.350
Don't listen to their nonsense.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.119
We're just roommates and teammates.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.221
Is that so?

00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:42.523
I've known you since junior high,

00:16:42.523 --> 00:16:43.958
and I've never seen you so clingy to anyone.

00:16:44.725 --> 00:16:45.960
Me?

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.828
There are reasons for all of that.

00:16:48.729 --> 00:16:50.030
Then tell me,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.665
what's going on between you and Jiang Chi?

00:16:52.599 --> 00:16:54.101
It's just that we're living together,

00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:55.436
and we're just close.

00:16:56.036 --> 00:16:59.039
In those photos, it looks like
you guys are in a relationship.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.842
You guys are too much.

00:17:01.842 --> 00:17:03.644
We're both men.

00:17:05.145 --> 00:17:07.114
I really don't know what you guys are thinking.

00:17:07.114 --> 00:17:08.115
Please.

00:17:08.115 --> 00:17:09.883
There's no gender difference in love.

00:17:09.883 --> 00:17:12.052
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:17:12.052 --> 00:17:15.155
Besides, the Ice Face is only nice to you.

00:17:15.155 --> 00:17:17.257
Anyone with eyes can see that, okay?

00:17:17.257 --> 00:17:18.359
If you don't have feelings for him,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:19.560
why would he throw himself at you?

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.894
What are you talking about?

00:17:20.894 --> 00:17:23.230
It's all because you guys forced me
to get him on the team.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.400
And you said, if he doesn't join,
you won't let me play.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.535
Otherwise, I don't even
have time to play games,

00:17:28.535 --> 00:17:30.671
why would I bother talking to him?

00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:32.906
So you treated him well
just to trick him into the team?

00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:38.812
Thank you for your hard work

00:17:38.812 --> 00:17:40.514
and so much sacrifice for the team.

00:17:41.782 --> 00:17:43.684
It's not exactly like that.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.008
Where are you?

00:18:08.008 --> 00:18:09.877
Will you let me explain?

Angry about what?

00:19:01.328 --> 00:19:03.630
About you were only nice to me
to trick me into joining the team?

00:19:04.164 --> 00:19:06.467
I just said that earlier because I was afraid

00:19:06.467 --> 00:19:08.068
they would spread rumors.

00:19:10.804 --> 00:19:12.306
I admit

00:19:12.306 --> 00:19:15.409
getting you into the basketball team
was to realize the captain's dream

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:17.511
of winning a few games before he graduates.

00:19:18.112 --> 00:19:19.880
What does other people's dream
have to do with you?

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.815
You're always glued to me and hugging me.

00:19:21.815 --> 00:19:23.250
Even if I kissed you, you didn't turn away.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.818
It was all for the basketball team?

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:28.956
I'm so sorry that you had
to sacrifice so much for the team.

00:19:29.857 --> 00:19:31.325
I like sticking with you

00:19:31.325 --> 00:19:34.194
because I feel comfortable with you.

00:19:34.194 --> 00:19:35.762
Can you be clear?

00:19:35.762 --> 00:19:37.297
Don't leave me hanging.

00:19:37.297 --> 00:19:38.532
I like you.

00:19:39.066 --> 00:19:40.534
Don't say you don't feel it.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.206
I… I…

00:19:45.206 --> 00:19:47.508

You.

[Stay by My Side]

00:22:25.132 --> 00:22:26.500
He said he likes me,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.501
and asked me if I like him.

00:22:27.501 --> 00:22:29.236
I just wanted to not hear the ghost's voice,

00:22:29.236 --> 00:22:30.554
so I approached him.

00:22:30.554 --> 00:22:32.172
Enough with the gifts.

00:22:32.172 --> 00:22:33.907
Your moves are not working.

00:22:33.907 --> 00:22:36.843
If you like him, win him over.

00:22:37.477 --> 00:22:38.929
You really like me, right?

00:22:38.929 --> 00:22:40.447
No matter why I approached you,

00:22:40.447 --> 00:22:42.549
or whether I hid things from you,

00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:44.551
you'd still like me, right?

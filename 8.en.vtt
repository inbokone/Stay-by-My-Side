00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.828
I didn't know you were into this sort of stuff.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.465
I didn't know you'd got such dirty thoughts.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.714
Go forward, yes. Stop there.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.449
- Take it, yes.
- This one?

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.338
Okay, stop.

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:56.756
Come a little closer.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.860
Okay, let go, reach forward.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.029
Bingo.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.865
Alright, turn around.

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.400
We are now moving towards the third gift.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.703
Are you ready?

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.512
Gu Buxia is another year older.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.613
Zhenghong.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.586
Baiwei.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:29.556
Yunhao.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.293
Dai Han.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.931
Jiang Chi, where's yours?

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.703
Did you make it yourself?

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.211
But this is pretty ugly.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.247
Those people in the baking class

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.515
laughed at me all day.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.832
If you don't want it, fine.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.253
Thanks for the love, Chi bro.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.242
After Grandpa passed away,

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.577
I never blew out any candles again.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.813
I never thought that one day,

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.082
I would be celebrating my birthday
with another person.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.885
However, his kindness to me

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.953
made me feel very guilty.

00:02:43.693 --> 00:02:49.607
(Newton and the Apple)

♫ When I think of you ♫

00:02:52.903 --> 00:02:58.503
♫ I think about the first time we met ♫

00:02:58.503 --> 00:03:00.039
♫ Suddenly my heart flipped ♫

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:06.119

00:03:08.182 --> 00:03:11.943
♫ You're Newton, and I'm the apple ♫

00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:15.687

(Stay by My Side)

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:50.663
Happy Birthday.

00:04:03.814 --> 00:04:08.120
(Episode 8)
(Can all wishes come true?)

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:37.644
On the 21st birthday of an Irish person,

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.512
they get a key to their house.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.848
Although this is still a bit far away for us,

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.984
I hope in the future, you and I

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.153
can share the same key.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.901
I asked Bai Yunhao,

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.771
and he said you didn't like blowing candles,

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.473
and didn't like celebrating
in front of everyone,

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.776
but when you were young,

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:11.911
your grandpa liked to make noodles for you.

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:18.851
Gu Buxia,

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.154
I'm a bit boring

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.388
and stubborn,

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.624
but when I care about someone,

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.392
I will give it my all.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:30.947
So you need to tell me if there's a problem.

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:32.498
The premise is

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:34.000
I don't like being lied to.

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:38.871
Don't leave.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.275
Jiang Chi.

00:05:58.691 --> 00:05:59.992
Gu Buxia,

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:01.427
I'm a bit boring

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:02.695
and stubborn,

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:04.964
but when I care about someone,

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.466
I will give it my all.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:10.236
So you need to tell me if there's a problem.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:50.543
Hey, bro.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:53.045
Sis, did Jiang Chi go to see you yesterday?

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.080
Yeah.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.481
What do you mean "yeah"?

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:57.016
Why didn't you tell me?

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.785
He asked me not to tell you.

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.386
I'm your brother.

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:03.890
And he's my brother's heater and boyfriend.

00:07:06.557 --> 00:07:07.635
(Secret)

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:14.367
Who did you say you are to Gu Buxia?

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:15.568
I'm his roommate and boyfriend.

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.669
Jiang Chi.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.304
A sophomore in the law department.

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:20.106
We just started dating not long ago.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.074
I'm not sure if Buxia has mentioned

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:23.509
our relationship to you.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.878
But I thought I'd be responsible

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.113
and pay you a visit

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.614
to let you know.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:46.599
Tell me,

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:49.035
- what's going on between you and my brother?
- I...

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:52.338
Jiang Chi, aren't you the heater guy?

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:54.040
Did my brother confess his feelings to you?

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:56.275
He became sensible.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:58.461
- Well…
- Did he pursue you and you agreed?

00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:01.547
Our Buxia really has a charm that scares.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.883
What do you mean "heater guy"?

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.737
I've never heard Buxia mention this person.

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.623
When talking to the law department,
one has to be careful.

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:12.391
Did you get tricked into saying something?

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:15.361
You didn't tell him I rely on him
to shield ghost sounds, did you?

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:18.397
No, I just brushed it aside.

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:20.166
I don't know if you really like him,

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.835
or you are dating him as a tool.

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.178
Why did you come to see me today?

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.880
I asked Yunhao for the address.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.650
Today is his birthday. Although Buxia stopped
celebrating after his grandpa passed away,

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.652
I still want to secretly
prepare something for him.

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:43.256
He is really good to you.

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:47.527
He asked me for a peace charm
painted by Grandpa.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.295
Asked about the Pork Knuckle Noodle

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.563
that Grandpa used to buy for you.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:52.498
Then he left in a hurry.

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.767
He even said that
the next time you bring him home,

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:57.103
I have to pretend it's the first time we met.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.804
If I hadn't found out,

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.973
I would have no idea what he did.

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.421
Won't this be too much for him?

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.256
The coursework in the law department
is already heavy.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.757
He still has to work.

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.559
Now he even has to look at your reports.

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.164
By the way,

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.433
why did he ask me
for the temple address the other day?

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.867
You didn't tell him?

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:11.310
Or is this a couple's thing?

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:16.132
By the way, I forgot to ask,

00:10:16.132 --> 00:10:18.751
did anything only for adults happen

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:21.454
on the night of your birthday?

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.689
We cleared the field for you for so long.

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:24.957
Exactly.

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:27.526
What's wrong?

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:34.834
Don't you guys think Jiang Chi

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.003
is a bit blind to like me?

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.871
Everyone thinks you are great, okay?

00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:41.107
Don't know what method you used
to conquer the Ice Cube Jiang.

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:42.708
He's nine, you're three.

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:44.577
Even divided by you, it's still you.

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:48.547
In your opinion,

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.616
what do I have that's worth his liking?

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:52.652
Don't be unaware of the blessings you have.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:53.819
You're overthinking it.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:54.954
Love is love.

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:56.522
Who cares if it's worth it?

00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:30.823
This week is hectic for me.

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:32.892
Take care of yourself.

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:34.660
Remember to take the clothes in.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.128
It will rain at night.

00:11:56.827 --> 00:12:14.976
(Text messages)

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.296
Are they talking about Jiang Chi like this

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:46.098
because of me?

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:54.573
What's wrong?

00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:01.680
Why didn't you go to the previous camp?

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.917
I wasn't interested in the content,

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.485
so I gave it to others.

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:07.920
It's two weeks.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.088
I don't have the time.

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.424
If you're so busy,

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.995
why don't you quit the basketball team?

00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:20.332
My point is,

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:22.735
the law department has
so many courses and activities.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.070
Plus, there's basketball team practice...

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:28.774
Did someone complain
that I'm not practicing enough

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:30.109
or...

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:32.344
No, no one said anything.

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:33.846
I just think

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.751
you're spending too much time on me.

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:41.353
Don't let dating become a talking point.

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:42.955
Didn't you want me to be with you?

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:44.356
Why are you starting to find me annoying now?

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:48.027
How could I possibly find you annoying?

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:52.131
Are you going to participate
in that JESSUP debate?

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.171
Aren't your parents angry
about you switching to law?

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.940
You can take this opportunity
and prove yourself...

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.952
Why would I prove anything?

00:14:01.952 --> 00:14:03.242
Why do you all

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:04.844
keep telling me to do this or that?

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:07.880
What are you impatient about?

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.415
Isn't it all for your own good?

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.950
What's your reason for not going?

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.984
Don't say it's to be with me.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.353
Yes, it is to be with you.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:16.255
That damn camp lasts for two weeks,

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:18.057
and the school is about to have
intensive training for a week.

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:19.425
Not to mention that JESSUP.

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:20.726
How are you going to handle it?

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:22.661
Why is it about me?

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:24.196
Don't use me as an excuse.

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.198
Did I say I need you to be with me every day?

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:29.034
What would you do if I'm not around
and you start hearing those voices again?

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:36.342
Our family can perceive certain existences,

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:39.144
but Buxia has been very timid
since he was a child,

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:41.747
so Grandpa sealed it for him when he was young.

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:43.749
But after an accident,

00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:46.969
Buxia suddenly started
hearing the voices of ghosts.

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:50.155
Those ghost voices would appear unpredictably,

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.424
and he found that whenever he was around you,

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.960
the voices would instantly disappear.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.033
He has been afraid to tell you about this,

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.636
because he's afraid you'll think he's crazy,

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:07.773
and you'll misunderstand
that he's just using you as a tool.

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.476
That time when you were angry and ignored him,

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.845
he was so worried that he couldn't sleep.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:14.780
Alright,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.750
it was also because he was disturbed
by the voices and couldn't sleep well.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.687
Isn't there a solution?

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:23.823
What if I'm not by his side?

00:15:23.823 --> 00:15:27.760
It's a matter of time, luck, and fate.

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:31.797
He met you who can block these voices,

00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:33.532
but when you're not there,

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:36.936
he has to face it and bear it himself.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.171
Even if he's scared, he has to endure it

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:42.074
until we find a solution.

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.133
No wonder you went to find Grandpa

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.969
and engraved the charm for me.

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:14.239
I know it might be useless,

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:16.308
but it's some consolation.

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.013
So, you really did give up

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:22.348
all that just for me?

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:24.083
I'm not giving anything up.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:25.684
I made a choice.

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:29.455
Is your choice really worth it?

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:31.824
Is it really for my sake?

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.326
I do rely on you,

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.694
but one day when you're not here,

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:37.696
I still have to rely on myself.

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.473
What are you doing?

00:16:47.473 --> 00:16:48.874
I don't want to argue with you.

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.442
Let's both calm down.

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:53.579
Are you planning to run away from home now?

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.713
What do you want me to do?

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:57.182
I want to be there for you because I care,
and you think it's not worth it.

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.684
I'm learning to let you be on your own.

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.119
Isn't that right?

00:17:06.048 --> 00:17:09.888
♫ Sorry, I wasn't what you wanted ♫

00:17:09.888 --> 00:17:13.177
♫ Sorry to make you feel
like something's missing ♫

00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:17.133
♫ I gave you all I could give ♫

00:17:17.133 --> 00:17:22.116
♫ But it's barely what you needed ♫

00:17:22.116 --> 00:17:26.007
♫ If I'm just someone you need ♫

00:17:26.007 --> 00:17:29.026
♫ Someone who can easily be replaced ♫

00:17:29.026 --> 00:17:34.016
♫ Quitting this habit would be worth it ♫

00:17:34.016 --> 00:17:40.232
♫ I wish you could be happier than now ♫

00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:56.942
Child.

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:59.829
He's not here so you should
be able to hear me, right?

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.113
Do me a favor.

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:02.147
Pass on a message for me.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:03.949
You guys be kind.

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:05.317
Didn't you see the fight last night?

00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:06.685
He's not in a good mood.

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:09.688
It's just a breakup.

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:11.190
We're not breaking up.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.691
You're the one having a breakup.

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:15.278
Your whole family is breaking up.

00:18:15.278 --> 00:18:16.695
It's better to break up.

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:21.117
I knew you could hear me. Why the act?

00:18:21.117 --> 00:18:24.269
Since you can hear, why not help us out?

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.439
Considering we've been roommates for so long,

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:30.025
Buxia, please help me first.

00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:33.412
Even if I want to help,
I have to be in the mood.

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:36.916
When that boy comes back,
you won't be able to hear us.

00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:38.884
That also depends on whether he can come back.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:42.754
As an experienced person,
I'll tell you something.

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:44.957
Just because Jiang treats you well,

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:48.026
it doesn't mean you can take him for granted.

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:49.461
I don't know that.

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:51.513
If you don't know something, learn.

00:18:51.513 --> 00:18:55.601
At the beginning, my husband
almost divorced me,

00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:59.138
but I begged and begged

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.806
until he forgave me.

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:04.743
I miss him so much.

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:07.312
Please help us out.

00:19:30.532 --> 00:19:34.410
♫ Close your eyes and listen to the time ♫

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:41.469
♫ Take me back to my encounter with you ♫

00:19:41.469 --> 00:19:45.989
♫ That year, that day ♫

00:19:45.989 --> 00:19:50.490
♫ The blazing kapok
next to the basketball court ♫

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:56.315
♫ You and I are hypothesizing on the wall ♫

00:19:56.315 --> 00:20:02.055
♫ A forever with each other's existence ♫

00:20:02.055 --> 00:20:05.902
♫ We walk and walk ♫

00:20:05.902 --> 00:20:09.921
♫ Still ended up to a full stop ♫

00:20:09.921 --> 00:20:15.555
♫ We are busy being silent, even forgetting ♫

00:20:15.555 --> 00:20:18.364
♫ To say sorry ♫

00:20:18.364 --> 00:20:26.076
♫You leave me stranded in a sea of people ♫

♫ Crying for help on an island of memories ♫

♫ I don't want anyone to find out ♫

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:39.071
Calm down.

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.607
What on earth are you doing, Gu Buxia?

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.308
There's nothing serious about breaking up.

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:44.610
You can always find another relationship.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.378
Yes, this is the Confession Lake.

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:48.513
If you jump in, many couples
will be scared away.

00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:50.215
I didn't wear much makeup today.

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:52.951
I would be ugly on TV, so don't set me up.

00:20:54.634 --> 00:21:01.273
♫ Your face contours, brows, eyes,
moments of sorrow, and happiness ♫

00:21:01.273 --> 00:21:08.295

00:21:08.295 --> 00:21:12.032
♫ If there were a ticket ♫

00:21:12.032 --> 00:21:13.888
♫ Let's jump back to that second ♫

00:21:13.888 --> 00:21:17.757
♫ I'd hug you tight before you fade ♫

00:21:17.757 --> 00:21:19.979
♫ Let me be your straw ♫

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:22.797
♫ To soothe away your sorrow ♫

00:21:22.797 --> 00:21:32.501
♫ A warm straw, and that's all ♫

00:21:32.501 --> 00:21:39.829
♫ Don't leave me stranded in a sea of people ♫

00:21:40.533 --> 00:21:44.757

♫ I miss you ♫

00:21:54.709 --> 00:21:58.255
♫ Like a burning fire ♫

00:21:58.255 --> 00:22:01.717
♫ Breaking taboos and boundaries ♫

00:22:01.717 --> 00:22:05.749
♫ Spreading endlessly ♫

00:22:06.293 --> 00:22:10.293
♫ You hear that, don't you? ♫

00:22:10.293 --> 00:22:13.941
♫ I finally get it now♫

00:22:14.677 --> 00:22:20.277
♫ What I never said to you ♫

00:22:22.773 --> 00:22:26.741
♫ Answer me if you can hear me ♫

00:22:29.045 --> 00:22:30.325
♫ Okay? ♫

00:22:30.325 --> 00:22:32.341
(Stay by My Side)

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.387
You are mine.

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:37.740
I've made a mark, so you can't be taken away.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.924
No matter what happens,

00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:41.043
as long as you stay,

00:22:41.043 --> 00:22:42.227
I won't leave.

00:22:42.227 --> 00:22:43.729
There are two Jiang Chis.

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:45.931
Let me tell you.

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:47.132
He's over there.

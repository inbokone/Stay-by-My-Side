since he's so scared,

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.684
we should keep sealing his ability.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.667
I accidentally burned
a corner of Buxia's talisman.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.869

I think I had a nightmare.

In my dream, I was holding a severed hand.

You held it so tightly.

I couldn't shake it off.

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:06.332
There was someone who wanted
to shake hands with me,

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.944
What did you think?

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.447
Didn't expect you to be so kind-hearted.

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:56.482

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.305

00:17:03.305 --> 00:17:04.890
Are you okay?

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:08.894
I think I'm fine.

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.829
I might have caught a cold last night.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.399
Why didn't you come inside
to sleep when you got back?

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.902
I didn't know where I put my key.

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:19.104
It was late at night, and you
must have been sound asleep.

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:20.305
I didn't want to wake you.

00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:22.041
Thought I'd just nestle outside.

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:25.144
But it was like I was in a freezer.

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:29.648
But thank you for saving my life.

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.862
Why is my head swollen here?

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.270
You're going to be late.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.272
Sorry, you had to take care of me.

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:56.842
How do you know my class schedule?

00:17:57.609 --> 00:18:00.245
We've been living together
for two weeks, right?

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:03.415
Alright.

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:04.917
You'd better go to class.

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.518
I'll sleep a little longer.

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.398
I want to appeal.

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:12.251
I got electrocuted by water leaks
and electricity leaks.

00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:19.258
Who is it?

00:19:21.593 --> 00:19:23.529
So rude,

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:26.265
playing radio drama so loudly.

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:37.809
Even ghosts get lonely.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:39.811
Can you hear me?

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.196
Or can you see me?

00:19:41.196 --> 00:19:42.314
Excuse me.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.319
I want to file a complaint.

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:16.582
Please. I'm going crazy just hearing it.

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:18.050
Please don't let me see it.

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:30.529
Help.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.368
Save me.

[Stay by My Side]

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.054
Actually, he's quite cute
when he's not being sarcastic.

00:22:34.867 --> 00:22:36.608
Are you trying to scare someone
with your timid heart?

00:22:36.608 --> 00:22:37.664
I have a friend

00:22:37.664 --> 00:22:40.032
who keeps harassing someone in various ways.

00:22:40.032 --> 00:22:42.165
You are really special to me.

00:22:43.072 --> 00:22:47.023
It's body language that shows affection.

00:22:48.064 --> 00:22:50.649
If I'm so special to you,
let's see your actions.

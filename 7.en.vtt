No,

I was just too bored alone in the dorm.

And I was hungry.

Buxia, did you break up?

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.679
Were they ever a couple?

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.381
Yeah, of course.

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.350
But now they've definitely broken up.

Pretend what?

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.364
Isn't it all because of you guys,

I didn't.

Oh you novice,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.755
is it because you don't know how to love

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:05.091
or how to express it?

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:10.296
I'm really stupid.

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:12.298
I don't know what to do at all.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.451
He seems to be sincere,

00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:16.702
but I,

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.574
I just want to get close to him

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:22.842
to get rid of the ghosts' voices.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.745
It is one conditional relationship.

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:27.747
Am I not despicable?

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.083
He asked to clarify
that we're not in a relationship.

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:33.085
But that's just not true!

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:36.956
Why give it too many thoughts?

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:41.477
If you like him, just go for it.

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:43.463
If you don't like him,

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.465
you can just use him.

you wouldn't be bothered now.

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.943
You know, when you fall for someone,

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:59.178
you miss them when they're not around.

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:01.747
And when you're together, you're very happy.

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:04.917
Doing stuff with them

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.385
feels warm.

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.721
Especially during those intimate moments,

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.490
you don't want to push them away,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.558
but instead, your heart races

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.560

you two weren't in a relationship, right?

Maybe he was just shy.

Damn, they are really a thing now.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:23.122
I could really use a boyfriend.

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:26.592
Somebody please come hold my hand.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:29.461
When can I go find him?

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:32.932
Hey, now's not the time to be envious.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.267
They stick together all day long.

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.870
What about us?

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.439
Yeah, we're doomed.

[Library]

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:16.342
I feel sleepy whenever I open a book.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.410
Be serious.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.045
Aren't you afraid of failing the exam?

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.515
What if you couldn't graduate with me?

00:16:39.578 --> 00:16:45.600
[Sure you don't want that law internship?
There's only one place. It'll be worth it.]

00:16:54.638 --> 00:16:56.960
[Give the opportunity to others, thank you.]

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.096
[Are you free tomorrow?
The professor wants to ask you about the case.]

00:17:00.096 --> 00:17:06.688
[Email me, I'm busy tomorrow.
I'll get it done for you at midnight.]

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.475
Why are you leaving so early today?

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:24.543
I have to go for rehabilitation later.

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:25.544
I've got class.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:27.079
Tuition.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.981
How come you're all busy today?

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.416
You can go to Jiang Chi.

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.418
He's gone to work.

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.053
I was thinking about inviting you to dinner.

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.821
- Suddenly felt like having hot pot.
- We have to go!

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:37.923
Keep it up!

Fighting!

What was I doing

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.852
when Jiang Chi wasn't around?

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:09.254
Ugh, I can't remember now.

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:46.258
Hiding our relationship is deception.

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:47.993
Don't you know that?

00:18:49.088 --> 00:18:50.162
It's because--

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.530
Stop.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.931
I don't want to hear anything.

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:54.533
I didn't dare to tell you

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:56.101
because I'm afraid you'll ignore me,

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:57.536
that you'll leave me!

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:59.705
Don't I deserve your trust?

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:01.006
If my feelings for you

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:03.041
are taken as a tool,

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.543
then I'd rather take it back

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:05.911
and throw it in the trash can.

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:07.379
Hey! Don't leave!

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:11.583
Yeah yeah, where are you going…

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.955
Yelling, really?

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:19.358
Aren't you supposed to work all day?

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:21.059
Follow me.

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:33.872
I didn't think you're the 'birthday' type.

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:35.207
I don't do birthdays,

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:36.675
but for you, I'd do it.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.147
So you've cleared the place.

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:45.083
Of course. I can't let anyone disturb us.

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.587
Come eat the noodles, for lasting health.

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:32.431
I didn't know you're into this sort of stuff.

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:36.101

💞 kissasian.one 💞

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.767
Senior, what's your plan after graduation?

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:10.900
I'm gonna be a trainee in Korea.

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.700
No wonder you were dancing over there.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.967
Yeah, I was teaching him the beat earlier.

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:18.767
You didn't even take basketball that seriously.

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:19.133
Dancing, though?

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.167
Right. You guys aren't serious.

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:21.500
I'd love to see it.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.867
Come on.

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:24.133
What?

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:25.467
Give it to me.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:27.067
Hang on,

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.167
you two are fighting again.

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:30.367
Bu-Xia,

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:32.733
try to be nicer to him.

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:33.800
I'm mean?

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm the bad guy?

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.167
He doesn't let me have any drinks.

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:38.133
You can't have iced drinks.

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:39.833
Otherwise, your trachea will contract.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.500
Besides, your allergy almost led to asthma.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.533
Drinks aren't allowed,

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:44.833
because it's too cold and sweet,

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:47.000
which will worsen your nose allergy.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:49.600
This is apple and tomato juice with honey.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.500
You tried it before
and you thought it was alright.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.800
I won't exhaust myself with part-time jobs,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.000
and I won't give up my education for you.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.467
Thank you,

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:11.100
for always caring about me.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:15.567
Sometimes, I get a busy schedule

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.467
and I tend to have a bad temper.

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:20.133
I'm the one with bad temper.

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:22.967
Anyway, you know what I mean.

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:28.933
Well, Bu-Xia,

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:31.000
look at you,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.500
being considerate to Jiang-Chi.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.967
This is good.

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:38.367
It's easier to keep your better half.

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:39.167
Yeah.

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:40.933
Stop fighting all the time.

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:42.200
Whenever you fight,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.233
you stop passing the ball.

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:45.167
I'm' gonna graduate soon,

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:46.700
and what's gonna happen to our varsity?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.533
I agree.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:48.567
When the captain is gone,

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.500
who's gonna keep the eyes on you two?

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:52.567
Promise us,

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:55.833
that you will always keep the people together.

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:02.467
I'm aware of my temper,

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:04.367
our tempers aren't the nicest,

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.533
but we gotta make a deal.

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:07.267
When I get mad,

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:09.133
you can't get mad.

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:11.000
Plus, it's important that we are happy,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.733
and lovey-dovey every day.

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:16.933
Jiang-Chi,

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:19.533
you've always been strict with him.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.867
Just tell him everything you've done for him.

00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:24.600
Don't keep it from him.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.000
Once he realizes,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.467
he won't be throwing tantrums that much

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:28.767
every time you treat him like this,

00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:30.267
alright?

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:32.300
Tell him how much blood
and sweat you've given.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.533
I mean, as bystanders, it's hard for us

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:35.333
to watch you go through these hardships.

00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:36.067
Hard for you?

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:39.067
What do you say, Jiang-Chi,

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:41.000
go tell him.

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.400
We're feeling lonely and cold.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.633
Give us some love,

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:48.633
alright, Jiang-Chi.

00:03:48.733 --> 00:03:50.167
What's up with the space-out?

00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:51.167
Are you still mad?

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:52.267
Seriously.

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:03.133
Fine, I won't have drinks.

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:05.000
I mean, just drink less,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.533
okay?

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:08.800
It tastes great.

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:21.400
Look at our necklaces.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.100
They are still quite shiny.

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.200
I'm being nice to you in my way.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.200
You get it, right?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.767
Isn't that cool?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.400
(SP: Forever Together Seems Like the Best Option)

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.467
Well done.

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:52.933
You've received the Presidential Award
and passed the National Examination.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:55.000
You've landed yourself an internship.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.600
It's because I want to give you
a worry-free life.

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:00.933
Well when you say it like that,

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:03.200
It sounds like I'm loser.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.433
How so?

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:06.067
My grandpa was the one to blame.

00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:08.200
He said he was gonna take care of me forever.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.900
Even at the gathering, my sister...

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.733
always only wanted me to be happy.

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:14.633
When I was sick as a kid,

00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:16.400
my classmates had to drag themselves to class

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.133
and I didn't even have to pretend to be ill.

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:20.700
My grandpa would let me stay at home.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.967
Plus, whenever I couldn't finish
my summer homework,

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:24.600
the apprentices at the temple would help me.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.667
Did it ever occur to you

00:05:25.767 --> 00:05:27.900
that perhaps you were quite likeable.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.800
Stop protecting me like everybody else does.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.467
I don't wanna end up falling behind everyone.

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:34.867
Think about it.

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.900
When you get enlisted in the army
after graduation,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
you'd go straight to get an internship,

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.467
wearing suits and ties to work.

00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:43.967
Mingling with high officials
is your new everyday.

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:45.633
What if someone is interested in you,

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:47.333
or someone decides to throw you some cash?

00:05:47.433 --> 00:05:48.867
What should I do then?

00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:50.467
Your parents are both doctors,

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:51.767
and you are a lawyer.

00:05:51.867 --> 00:05:53.867
What am I then?

00:05:57.267 --> 00:05:59.733
Don't you dare question my taste.

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:06.900
What on earth are you thinking?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.033
You were the one who told me

00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:09.533
to speak my mind at any time.

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:11.533
Why are you laughing?

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:14.300
I could always look for jobs,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.900
but I have no idea in what fields.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.567
There's no rush.

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.733
Besides, you inherited a shrine.

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:23.300
A tiny shrine.

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:26.433
The thing is, I couldn't even be

00:06:26.533 --> 00:06:27.967
a mouthpiece for the spirits.

00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:30.200
What more could I do to help at the shrine?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.233
Oh,

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:34.367
every time I asked my sister

00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:35.500
why I couldn't hear what the ghosts were saying

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.467
all of a sudden,

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:39.000
she just brushed it off.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.833
Did she try to do something behind my back?

00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:44.900
Well...

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.867
Didn't the apprentices say

00:06:47.967 --> 00:06:50.733
they were setting up a creative company
that needed your help?

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:53.567
So the apprentices are taking care
of us for the rest of our lives?

00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:56.267
How do the rest of our lives
have anything to do with him?

00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:57.567
Of course, it does.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.833
For all my life,
apart from my grandpa and sister,

00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:02.500
the apprentices love me the most.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.233
And me?

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:04.100
You...

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.600
You come after them.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.600
Why is that?

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.400
You come last.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.300
I come last?

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.267
The apprentices are different.

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:10.867
They don't pick fights with me.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.967
Apprentice.

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:17.400
It's been so long.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.533
Seriously?

00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:19.733
Stop nudging.

00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:21.333
You're like a starving dog.

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:23.233
You're the bones.

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:25.233
A chunk of delicious meat.

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:26.800
You are unwanted bones

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.900
and bad meat.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.233
Look at you,

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:31.733
being rude to the apprentice.

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:33.733
He's gonna smack your ass for that.

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:35.367
Come chat with me.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.800
When Xia's parents were gone,

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.533
he couldn't stop crying.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.767
People picked on him at school.

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:56.600
His classmates said
because his family ran a shrine,

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.567
his parents got taken away by ghosts.

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:04.833
Xia's grandpa stated clearly

00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:06.933
that Xia was our responsibility.

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:10.933
That's why we spoil him.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.933
Even if that's the case,

00:08:13.033 --> 00:08:16.100
you guys can't help him forever.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.167
He's got me now.

00:08:23.233 --> 00:08:25.833
You're too skinny,

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:31.400
but I've heard great things about you.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.933
Graduation is a major milestone in life.

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:40.033
Your school can't protect you
from the world anymore.

00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:43.067
You are gonna get thrown into the real world.

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:45.200
Survival of the fittest.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.267
I'm aware.

00:08:46.367 --> 00:08:48.133
I'm ready.

00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:50.567
You're ready,

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:53.567
but is Bu-Xia ready?

00:09:07.967 --> 00:09:09.900
My lucky charm was given by my sister.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.600
How come Jiang-Chi had his own before me?

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.300
How silly of you.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.967
His eight characters belong
at this place already.

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:16.767
Of course, we had to gift it to him ourselves.

00:09:16.867 --> 00:09:17.633
You know what?

00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:20.333
Your guys' fortunes intertwine.

00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:22.067
Get it?

00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:25.400
Still eating?

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.833
This was the prize of the lottery activity

00:09:28.933 --> 00:09:30.367
from the neighborhood.

00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:32.367
Fancy BnB hotels.

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:35.233
She wanted you guys to go on a graduation trip.

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:37.367
By the way I see it,
she's just not interested in the prize.

00:09:37.467 --> 00:09:39.467
That's why she gifted it to me.

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:42.100
This is the bonus

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.833
as your graduation allowance.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.467
You two go have fun.

00:09:47.567 --> 00:09:49.367
Bonus?

00:09:49.467 --> 00:09:53.167
Yeah, I've recently set up a creative company,

00:09:53.267 --> 00:09:55.800
Gu Yi-Xia, for the shrine.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.233
You are a shareholder,

00:09:57.333 --> 00:09:59.267
so you can get a share of the bonus.

00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:01.200
Our products have hit the market.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.267
Where can I buy them?

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:03.567
How come I didn't see any of it?

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:04.733
Nah, tell you something,

00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:06.900
keep it for now.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.033
Our catalog, unboxing,
and the lottery of the company

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:13.567
will be your responsibility.

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:15.400
You've got tons of ideas

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.533
and little contributions.

00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:19.433
The face is the only thing left.

00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:21.467
Me? Endorsement?

00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:24.633
Yi-Xia's endorsement.

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:26.533
It's hard to tell.

00:10:26.633 --> 00:10:28.767
Perhaps you'll have to look after the company.

00:10:28.867 --> 00:10:29.800
The internship I have now

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.133
is only worth 25 thousand.

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:34.467
Even though I have no idea

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:36.133
when the company is gonna close,

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:39.133
I'm not gonna look after you only for a while,

00:10:39.233 --> 00:10:40.933
I'm gonna do it forever.

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:43.533
Hey, Bu-Xia,

00:10:43.633 --> 00:10:45.967
where's your conscience?

00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:54.633
Silly,

00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:56.100
forever means a lot of effort,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.233
and you are happy about it?

00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:01.000
Grandpa,

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.300
no matter how much Xia sacrifices,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.533
I'm gonna double back.

00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:10.233
This is about your future here.

00:11:10.333 --> 00:11:11.467
Stay focused.

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:12.100
What?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.333
You don't want me to take care of you forever?

00:11:17.367 --> 00:11:18.733
As long as you don't push me away,

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:20.533
I'm not planning to leave.

00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:21.600
Even if I let you,

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.500
you aren't allowed to leave.

00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:10.200
Jiang-Chi, more kisses?

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.767
You'd better watch out on my territory.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.833
Thank you for your graduation present.

00:12:15.933 --> 00:12:17.533
You're gonna cook something for me.

00:12:17.633 --> 00:12:20.867
We are celebrating the joy of our graduation.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.467
Also, a celebration of you passing your exam.

00:12:24.567 --> 00:12:25.867
A casual celebration?

00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:28.200
It's not casual.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.100
Jiang-Chi,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.500
apart from my grandpa and my sister,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.867
I adore you the most.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.867
There's a swimming pool.

00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:45.500
It's huge.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.200
Let's go diving later.

00:12:49.067 --> 00:12:50.467
This dining table is also huge,

00:12:50.567 --> 00:12:52.567
which means you gotta cook more dishes.

00:12:53.133 --> 00:12:54.167
KTV.

00:12:55.533 --> 00:12:57.700
I'm gonna sing later.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.933
Wanna join me?

00:12:59.033 --> 00:13:00.267
Let's go.

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:06.533
Do you think that singer is more handsome,

00:13:06.633 --> 00:13:08.733
or Bu-Xia next to you?

00:13:10.167 --> 00:13:12.767
The answer to this question is quite obvious.

00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:14.633
Why can't you give me an answer immediately?

00:13:14.733 --> 00:13:15.500
Are you feeling guilty?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.833
No.

00:13:16.933 --> 00:13:18.900
This is a trick question.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.867
Never mind, well,

00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:21.867
let's sing.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:24.767
When I think about you,

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:30.367
I'll stare at the clock on the wall,

00:13:30.467 --> 00:13:32.100
tick-tock.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.567
It reminds me of the first time we met.

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:39.600
Heart pounding.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:45.133
This is my favorite song.

00:13:45.233 --> 00:13:46.967
Probably because...

00:13:47.067 --> 00:13:52.933
I imagine myself on a TV show again.

00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:49.033
Are you starving?

00:14:49.133 --> 00:14:49.767
I am.

00:14:49.867 --> 00:14:51.600
Let's go grab some food.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.667
I'll cook something for you.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:53.900
Absolutely.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.567
Hang on a second.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.967
Sit back down when you're done cleaning up.

00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:14.767
Okay.

00:15:14.867 --> 00:15:16.133
Wait for me.

00:15:16.233 --> 00:15:17.267
I...

00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:18.467
I'm gonna deal with something.

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:18.933
What are you dealing with?

00:15:19.033 --> 00:15:20.600
Stay still.

00:15:23.633 --> 00:15:24.833
Not stay still.

00:15:24.933 --> 00:15:25.733
I mean,

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:27.500
stay right here for a second.

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:36.400
Every time you stutter,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.300
you are hiding something from me.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.700
Sister Tao said your biggest dream

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.467
is to watch me in a suit.

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:09.700
What's that?

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.567
Apple tree.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.833
You love apples.

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:16.600
The very first gift you gave me

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.100
was an apple.

00:16:25.433 --> 00:16:27.733
Why do you like me?

00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:30.600
Well, why do you make me fall for you?

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.533
You study law.

00:16:31.633 --> 00:16:32.667
Can you try not to

00:16:32.767 --> 00:16:35.067
ask me rhetorical questions?

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.600
You know

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.300
that I'm not good with words,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.433
but my affection is real.

00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:43.867
The more I hang out with you,

00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:46.133
the more I thank myself
for transferring departments,

00:16:46.233 --> 00:16:49.133
moving into the dorm, not leaving,

00:16:49.733 --> 00:16:51.700
and opening up to you.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.367
My sister told you
I wanted to see you in suits,

00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:55.633
and you listened to her?

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:57.633
Don't you feel awkward about it?

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.600
As long as you want to,

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.200
I'm up for it.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.300
It's plastic.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.467
So it'll stay the way it is.

00:17:10.567 --> 00:17:12.233
The real apple tree is giant.

00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:14.333
The heart matters the most.

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:17.400
The heart does matter the most.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.067
See, you and me dress in different styles,

00:17:20.167 --> 00:17:21.833
and there is an apple tree in your hands,

00:17:21.933 --> 00:17:24.133
sitting here and acting sweet,

00:17:24.233 --> 00:17:26.800
while I have literally nothing here.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.933
It's alright, Jiang-Chi.

00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:29.933
I know you are a man of action,

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:31.967
but before you act on anything,

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:34.633
can you at least put yourself
in someone else's shoes?

00:17:55.567 --> 00:17:57.167
Xia once told his sister

00:17:57.267 --> 00:18:00.233
that if you wear a suit,
looking proper and serious,

00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:02.900
give him a very memorable present,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.267
and make him a promise,

00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:07.733
that will give him some security.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.167
Apprentice,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.400
a gesture of mine.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.567
What for?

00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:18.867
Are you trying to bribe me?

00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:20.300
Not at all.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.400
I want you to come up with a reason

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.033
to gift it to Bu-Xia.

00:18:24.133 --> 00:18:26.333
I tried to go on a trip with him
after graduation,

00:18:26.433 --> 00:18:27.467
but he kept saying no.

00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:29.733
He even gets mad talking about it.

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:31.633
Bu-Tao told me

00:18:31.733 --> 00:18:35.200
that your family refuses to provide for you.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.667
Make no mistake.
Even though Xia looks like a kid,

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:45.333
he pays attention to details.

00:18:45.433 --> 00:18:47.200
He must worry about you.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.767
He's got work and school on both ends,

00:18:49.867 --> 00:18:51.767
fearful that he will become your burden

00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:53.367
if he keeps staying with you.

00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:55.133
Having affection for someone means
doing extra work

00:18:55.233 --> 00:18:56.433
without ever asking for a reward.

00:18:56.533 --> 00:18:58.100
I know he wants to take a trip

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.600
but he doesn't want me to spend any money

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.867
while saving my face.

00:19:01.967 --> 00:19:04.400
I'm not that tired, to be honest.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.533
I just want to create
a memorable experience with him.

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:12.667
Not bad, huh.

00:19:14.033 --> 00:19:15.767
You passed.

00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:19.733
I can see you put in a lot of work,

00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:23.067
so I'm gonna help Bu-Tao give her words to you

00:19:23.167 --> 00:19:25.167
about Xia's wishes.

00:19:30.067 --> 00:19:32.600
Did they lie to me?

00:19:44.667 --> 00:19:47.367
My sister took it the wrong way.

00:19:47.467 --> 00:19:50.333
I've always wanted to find a time

00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:53.000
to express my affection toward you.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.833
Promise me you won't laugh.

00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:57.400
I'm not gonna say it twice.

00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:01.933
I don't want to be protected forever,

00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:05.133
and I don't plan on having
things done for me forever.

00:20:05.233 --> 00:20:06.300
If it's possible,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.267
Jiang-Chi, you can also rely on me.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.733
I know it's too early for now,

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:15.200
but you gave me a necklace before.

00:20:20.367 --> 00:20:22.200
Now it's my turn to give you a ring.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.167
Hopefully,

00:20:23.267 --> 00:20:25.833
our relationship can last forever.

00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:48.800
I like your eyes,

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.400
because they only smile when they look at me.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.500
I also like your lips.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.133
You aren't good with words,

00:20:59.233 --> 00:21:01.900
but you are a man of words.

00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.833
And I love your ears.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:11.633
Thank you for listening
to those voices on behalf of me.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.633
How did you...

00:21:18.733 --> 00:21:20.300
Your hand.

00:21:22.267 --> 00:21:24.233
The other one.

00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:30.867
Never thought the young one played it well.

00:21:32.867 --> 00:21:35.633
I never thought the older one hid it well.

00:21:35.733 --> 00:21:37.633
Be nice to him.

00:21:37.733 --> 00:21:40.500
Stop throwing tantrums like a kid.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.833
I'm telling you, be like a man.

00:21:42.933 --> 00:21:43.933
It's hard to find a man

00:21:44.033 --> 00:21:45.600
like me now.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.100
That's all.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.967
An accommodation coupon and an envelope.

00:21:49.067 --> 00:21:50.833
How hard it that?

00:21:50.933 --> 00:21:55.033
Besides, I treat him quite well.

00:22:01.433 --> 00:22:03.467
Truthfully, it's hard to find a man like him.

00:22:03.567 --> 00:22:06.067
You told him to overlap our eight characters,

00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:07.767
and he had to listen to the voices of ghosts.

00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:09.300
I can't believe he said yes.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.433
Besides, you two hadn't even met.

00:22:11.533 --> 00:22:12.800
Not me.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.467
Your sister found an ancient book.

00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:15.633
The book says it'll work.

00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:17.867
I thought I should give it a try.

00:22:17.967 --> 00:22:19.600
That's why I thought

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.000
he was good for you.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.867
Your relationship hadn't been that long,

00:22:24.967 --> 00:22:30.567
and he was willing to take this risk.

00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:32.700
Don't tell me you aren't aware of it.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.867
Didn't I tell you not to get behind my back?

00:22:34.967 --> 00:22:36.700
Why did you force him to do it?

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.100
What if something happens to him?

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:39.900
No.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.733
It was him who made your sister do it.

00:22:42.833 --> 00:22:45.300
Your sister was clear about the consequences.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.700
It seems to be working quite well now, anyway.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.700
He's braver than you are.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.033
He listens to the voices on behalf of you,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.867
and take on the burden.

00:22:59.067 --> 00:23:02.900
I just changed his lucky charm earlier.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.967
I don't want you to spend any money

00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:11.467
because whenever I'm with you,

00:23:11.567 --> 00:23:13.033
I'm the happiest.

00:23:13.133 --> 00:23:15.133
I don't like to see you getting exhausted.

00:23:16.267 --> 00:23:18.667
You've got work and school every day,

00:23:18.767 --> 00:23:20.967
plus some academic reports.

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:23.733
Now, you went behind my back
to swap our eight characters,

00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.367
which is why you hear the voices now.

00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:27.233
How are you gonna prepare for your exams?

00:23:27.333 --> 00:23:29.133
As long as I have you.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.167
As long as I can touch you.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.100
Are you upset?

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.033
Tao and I want the best for you.

00:23:40.133 --> 00:23:41.867
You guys seriously thought I was this naive.

00:23:41.967 --> 00:23:43.033
You could just brush them off,

00:23:43.133 --> 00:23:44.567
and I'd accept this version of the story?

00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:46.000
Untangle this, will you?

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.433
I wanna hug you.

00:23:47.533 --> 00:23:48.767
Hug me?

00:23:48.867 --> 00:23:50.067
Bro,

00:23:50.167 --> 00:23:51.200
I'm not flirting with you.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.300
It's a punishment.

00:23:57.933 --> 00:23:59.067
Can you stop doing that stuff

00:23:59.167 --> 00:24:01.033
behind my back?

00:24:01.133 --> 00:24:04.100
How am I gonna repay you in the future?

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.067
So I'm not going to.

00:24:07.133 --> 00:24:07.967
It's a lifetime debt,

00:24:08.067 --> 00:24:09.500
so there's no chance for you to run away.

00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:13.967
Get up.

00:25:15.267 --> 00:25:16.700
Morning.

00:25:18.633 --> 00:25:20.200
Morning.

00:25:21.033 --> 00:25:22.400
You aren't upset anymore.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.633
What happens if I'm upset?

00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:27.133
Tear up the amulet?

00:25:31.767 --> 00:25:33.333
Please don't.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.267
What if it gets worse?

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.633
Then you have to promise me,

00:25:38.733 --> 00:25:39.500
that whatever happens,

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.400
you have to tell me right away.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.033
Of course.

00:25:43.133 --> 00:25:45.033
Give me more kisses then.

00:25:45.133 --> 00:25:46.567
We'll save up the energy.

00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:48.133
Everything will be alright.

00:25:48.233 --> 00:25:51.033
The touch will make the voice disappear.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.167
You're gonna move out of the dorm
when you get back to school.

00:25:58.267 --> 00:26:00.367
What if you aren't used to living alone?

00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:02.100
What happens then?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.933
I still have one thing left to tell you,

00:26:05.033 --> 00:26:07.467
but you can't get mad.

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:10.167
I found a new place.

00:26:10.267 --> 00:26:11.533
Let's move in together.

00:26:11.633 --> 00:26:13.000
Sounds amazing!

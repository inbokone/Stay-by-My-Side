Of course.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.459
You dragged me into doing so many things and I agreed to all of them.

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:32.529
Well, turn around.

Help me find my daughter.

What should we do? He seems to really not hear us.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:44.061
Could it be his power has been temporarily sealed by Yang energy?

It seems like every time that guy Jiang Chi is around,

Gu Buxia can't hear us.

I'll take a look for you.

It's not like a boyfriend meets the family.

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:01.214
Besides, I can't always depend on him.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.049
What if he ignores me one day?

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.084

Even as ghosts, we should have a conscience.

Don't say we ghosts don't have a conscience.

Where's Jiang Chi? I haven't seen him these days.

You relied on Jiang Chi, but he's gone now.

It's best to rely on oneself.

Please. We can order delivery or eat out.

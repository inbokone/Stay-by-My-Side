00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.439
Jiang Chi, where's my little brother?

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:09.108
He just fainted in the bathroom,

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:10.576
and I had the school doctor look at him.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.011
He should be fine.

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:14.447
He said someone scared him, so he slipped.

00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:17.616
What happened? It seems like you've been calling him a lot.

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:19.318
I'm not sure either.

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:22.688
Just now, the talisman
that Grandpa sealed for him had a crack on it.

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:24.323
So I thought I'd give him a call,

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:26.592
afraid something might happen to him.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.227
Do you have any other options?

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:30.796
I can't be with him 24/7.

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:33.933
There seems to be a solution.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.000
You should take him back for now.

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:46.545
Jiang Chi, wait for me here,

00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:49.346
I need to buy something for my sister. I'll be back soon.

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:00.526
Luckily, only a little corner was burnt.

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:03.529
Buxia can now hear but not see.

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:08.565
But this crack…I'm afraid it won't hold.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:15.708
But I looked at the documents left by Grandpa,

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:18.209
and there's actually a way.

00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:20.245
First, we need to find a suitable person

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:23.613
and combine their 'Eight Characters' and Buxia's talisman.

00:16:23.613 --> 00:16:26.084
Can this prevent him from hearing and seeing?

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:32.255
But honestly, I don't know what will happen to that person.

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:34.593
After all, this is our family's destiny.

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:38.596
I feel a bit guilty to pass it to someone else.

00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:42.566
At most, they'll see and hear those things, isn't it?

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.203
Aren't you afraid?

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:48.505
Buxia said you, Grandpa, and Senior can all hear.

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:52.177
My brother may not be reliable,

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:55.280
but he's really good at judging people.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.983
You do seem like a good fit,

00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:01.653
after all, your body can make him not hear,

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:07.860
but it's said in the ancient books,

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.596
that the two people must be husband and wife.

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:17.636
Um, actually, in our tradition,

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:20.940
being husband and wife
doesn't refer to the ceremony,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.342
it means… Can't you just say it all at once?

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:25.744
If it's not a ceremony, then what is it?

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:32.651
I'm a girl, and you want me to be explicit?

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.158
Your process is slow, huh?

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:45.028
But it doesn't matter, we can make up for the progress.

00:17:45.028 --> 00:17:49.134
Sis Tao, is this real or did you make it up?

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:52.237
Would I joke about my brother?

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:53.605
But I don't know if it will work.

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:56.374
We can only hope for the best.

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.415
For the 'Eight Characters' to be effective,

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:06.118
firstly, that person must be sincere.

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:08.654
Buxia has to write
his 'Eight Characters' himself.

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:11.223
And finally, press it on with his own hands.

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:16.126
Do you think if we
tell Buxia about this method, he would agree to it?

00:18:16.126 --> 00:18:18.063
What are you doing?

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:23.135
I told you not to bully him.

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:25.337
I didn't mean for you to like him.

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:26.705
If you lack a boyfriend, find one yourself.

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:28.474
Jiang Chi is mine.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.419
My sister is bullying me.

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:42.454
Help me fight her.

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.323
I'll count on you.

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.759
- I've only been out for a little while.
- Let me see.

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:50.762
What have you two been up to behind my back?

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.366
Where does it hurt?

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:58.937
Actually, Grandpa always wanted me
to take over the temple.

00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:00.772
But once during a ceremony,

00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:03.008
I accidentally saw a terrifying scene,

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:05.410
and I had a fever for a week.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.646
So Grandpa had to give up this idea

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:09.381
and sealed it for me.

00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:11.617
If it weren't for my sister…

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:13.552
If it weren't for your sister's mistake,

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:15.954
you wouldn't have come to me, clinging to me.

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:17.489
We would probably be strangers.

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:20.259
What do you mean clinging to you?

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:23.061
You pursued me, not the other way around.

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:30.601
Gu Buxia, if there was a way

00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:33.071
for you to neither hear nor see those things,

00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:34.706
would you want it?

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:37.242
Of course.

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:40.045
But it depends on what the method is.

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:41.613
Luckily you're here now,

00:19:41.613 --> 00:19:43.815
so I'm not that scared.

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:48.537
Wait a minute,

00:19:48.537 --> 00:19:51.289
are you trying to get rid of me?

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:56.895
Don't knock me like my sister does.

00:19:56.895 --> 00:19:59.064
I'll get stupid.

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:01.433
Don't overthink with this head of yours.

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:03.735
Worry about what you should worry about.

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:10.174
Grandpa once told me, there is a certain number of people

00:20:10.174 --> 00:20:12.611
with destiny in this world.

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:14.012
If one loses it somewhere,

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:16.248
there will be one more somewhere else.

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:19.549
Sometimes, if I think about it, I'll forget the idea.

00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:21.086
If it's me, it's me.

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:23.188
If I wasn't so scared,

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:25.090
maybe I could even help them.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:29.993
Gu Buxia. You may be willing, but I'm not.

00:20:29.993 --> 00:20:33.029
You are mine, and you should stay by my side.

00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:35.067
What if you can't sleep well all day?

00:20:47.959 --> 00:20:50.590
♫ But I just want you to hear me ♫

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.803

♫ Okay ♫

00:22:29.687 --> 00:22:32.084
[Stay by My Side]

00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:35.487
You asked me how heavy my
'Eight Characters' are. How would I know?

00:22:35.487 --> 00:22:36.705
Why are you asking me this?

00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:39.823
Ask your sister to perform a ritual and bind us together.

00:22:39.823 --> 00:22:42.227
Whoever changes his heart first
won't be able to be erected.

00:22:42.227 --> 00:22:43.479
Do you dare to do it?

00:22:43.479 --> 00:22:46.263
Have you done everything you needed to do?

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:49.367
I'm sorry.

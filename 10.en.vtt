The resentment was so heavy.

Anyway, his attitude was bad
and he didn't play by the rules.

he was causing accidents.

it could only be my mom.

I was being serious.

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:49.522
So, what you're saying is

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:52.558
if I write his 'Eight Characters'
and press it with mine,

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:53.726
it should do it, right?

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:56.028
Yep, it helps to prevent fickleness.

00:09:57.363 --> 00:10:00.666
But what if it's removed one day?

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.702
Would it be like this never happened?

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.974
At such a young age, you want to be
a jerk and abandon someone?

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:09.375
No.

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.043
What I meant was,

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:12.678
if one day he doesn't like me anymore,

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:14.046
then so be it.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:15.514
I don't want to be clingy.

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:16.816
I can return his 'Eight Characters',

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:19.051
and just forget about it.

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.287
You might as well just go with the flow

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.022
and have a casual relationship.

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.091
But I'm not willing to give up.

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:26.626
He's got such good conditions.

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:30.129
You're being paranoid and dramatic.

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.632
Anyway, if his 'Eight Characters'
and yours are pressed together,

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.534
apart from the effect of binding you together,

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:39.005
it also ensures Jiang Chi's safety
and well-being.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.032
How about that?

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:44.710
I mean Jiang Chi is basically family now.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.379
So if his is with yours,

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.748
our ancestors can bless them together.

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:52.051

Your classmate called me
and said you had an accident.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.951

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:31.691
Did you break anything?

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:32.925
I was carrying things today,

00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:34.393
so I borrowed a scooter from a classmate.

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:35.995
There's just a minor scratch.

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:40.800
That's good to know.

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.737
Are you more concerned about me getting hurt

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.272
or about the bike needing repairs?

00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:49.175
Motorcycles are expensive.

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:51.777
I'm afraid if it breaks down and need repairs,

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:53.312
you'll either have to work more,

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:55.381
or bow down to your parents.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.983
But I can't bear either of these.

00:11:57.983 --> 00:12:01.087
And I don't have much money.

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:10.730
My parents never cared about my thoughts.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.132
They only force me to do what they want.

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.136
I'm sorry.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.406
I can't get their approval now.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.575
But if they come to trouble me again,

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.009
I promise,

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:25.711
I'll definitely stand by your side.

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:38.190
Does your sister's temple have
anything that can keep me safe?

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.526
or should I go there and light a candle?

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.797
Since when did you become so superstitious?

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:46.198
Because I want you to be at ease.

You're about to cut me off,

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:00.846
so why should I kiss you?

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.715
Give me a kiss, hurry up.

Have you done everything you needed to do?

Don't treat this as a game.

Sister, you seem to be blabbing
more and more nowadays.

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:58.497

Thank you for entrusting Buxia to me.

What do you mean entrusting?

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:38.837
It's more like custody, OK?

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:40.039
Let me tell you.

But I don't want him to get used to it.

Do you have time to join the basketball team?

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.644
That way, we'd have more chances to interact,

No.

How can you just deal with it?

When I was a kid and got hurt, Grandpa would help me like this.

00:08:09.587 --> 00:08:11.991
He said boys still need to be taken care of.

You really have a lot of these charms.

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.467

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.768
and Grandpa would prepare a lot for me.

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:59.005
You study medicine and law,

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.690
And our senior will graduate soon.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.058
So I thought that before that,

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:28.193
I'd better find someone to partner with Buxia

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:32.262
so that he can continue to soar on the basketball court he loves.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.067
I have a condition.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.170
[The two of them go well together]
 [A bit sweet...]

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.100
[Could it be a sign of tooth decay?]

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.850
[A top student in the Department of Law and a scumbag in the Department of Life Science... not optimistic]

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.770
[Upstairs, don't turn envy into jealousy]

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:04.663
What was so interesting on the phone?

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:07.065
Laughing so happily.

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:25.150
What good stuff are you looking at?

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:30.055
We're both men. Share.

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.525
Stingy.

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:35.293
Fine, I won't look.

00:16:55.414 --> 00:16:57.082
Are you in a mood?

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.886
You can tell?

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:03.621
After all, you usually jump around like a monkey.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.967
I know my daily habits aren't great,

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:18.305
and my attitude to you is sometimes too casual.

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:22.907
However, you don't regret living in the same dormitory with me, do you?

00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:25.944
No.

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:29.615
I thought you were moving out.

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:31.550
You saw it at noon.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.655
When I just moved in,

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:39.090
didn't you want me to find accommodations outside?

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:44.596
But I don't have money.

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.498
What's more,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.936
I got used to living with you after a while.

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:59.541
Actually, I really like you.

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:05.283
Even though I hated you at first.

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:07.819
You like me?

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:11.523
Don't get me wrong.

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:14.659
I just really like being with you,

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.930
and doing things together.

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:27.072
Do you really want me to join the basketball team with you?

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.082
Come with me to a place first.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.096
Thank you, guys.

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:52.197
Thanks.

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:53.248
I'll treat you to dinner another day.

00:18:53.248 --> 00:18:55.217
- All right.
 - Bye.

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:56.688
Let's go.

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:01.106
"Come with me to a place".

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:04.575
So you tricked me into helping your senior paint.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.619
Are you close with her?

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:19.757
Jealous?

00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:28.467
Her boyfriend asked me for help.

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:29.902
There's money in it.

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:31.203
I'll treat you to a meal.

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:33.037
Then I want half.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.307
I'll transfer it to you when we get back.

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:42.481
Why is mine red?

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.649
Because it came with the blue one.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.023
Wearing this kind of helmet while riding a heavy motorcycle.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.591
Isn't that ridiculous?

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:54.726
It's fine if the person is handsome.

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:58.463
If it weren't for the sentimental value of this bike,

00:19:58.463 --> 00:20:00.933
I would have sold it for living expenses long ago.

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.535
Did your parents really cut off your financial support?

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:05.736
What? You want to sponsor me?

00:20:05.736 --> 00:20:07.472
I don't have money.

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:10.175
But in the future, when you work part-time, you can take me with you.

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:13.244
So half of the payments count as me sponsoring you.

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.397
Didn't you say you would give me a reward?

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:34.265
You want a reward?

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:41.300
♫ My vision has run wild and my hearing is wrong,
 and I even laugh unconsciously ♫

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:45.376
Gu Buxia, you're trying so hard

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:47.578
to get Jiang Chi on the team.

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:50.715
I'm so touched.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.553
Wait! Why are those two so close?

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:58.490
So this is Jiang Chi's type.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.858
My Buxia.

00:20:59.858 --> 00:21:02.360
Is he finally coming out?

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.550
♫ I fell in love ♫

00:21:09.088 --> 00:21:11.111
The Deadlock CP original photo.

00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:14.420
Place your bet on who's the top and who's the bottom.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:19.070
♫ You and I hold hands tightly (hold tightly),
 striding (never missing out) ♫

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:25.210
♫ My chest is broad for you ♫

00:21:28.706 --> 00:21:36.034
♫ Don't leave me stranded in a sea of people ♫

00:21:36.738 --> 00:21:40.962
♫ Crying for help on an island of memories ♫

00:21:40.962 --> 00:21:44.695
♫ I don't want anyone to find out ♫

00:21:46.018 --> 00:21:48.738
♫ But just want you to hear me ♫

00:21:48.738 --> 00:21:50.914
♫ I miss you ♫

00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:54.460
♫ Like a wildfire ♫

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.922
♫ Breaking taboos and boundaries ♫

00:21:57.922 --> 00:22:01.954
♫ Spreading endlessly ♫

00:22:02.498 --> 00:22:06.498
♫ Did you hear that? ♫

00:22:06.498 --> 00:22:10.146
♫ I finally understand ♫

00:22:10.882 --> 00:22:16.482
♫ The words I never said to you ♫

00:22:18.978 --> 00:22:22.946
♫ Please answer me if you can hear me ♫

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.530
♫ Okay? ♫

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.640
💞 kissasian.one 💞

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.760
It's all your fault.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.817
Your movements caused misunderstandings.

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:33.819
How about we sleep together again tonight?

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:34.853
No way.

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.922
It's only the second day without being with Jiang Chi.

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:38.190
And my quota dropped so fast.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.257
When he's back,

00:22:39.257 --> 00:22:40.893
I'll see what your guys have to say.

00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:42.494
Did you not sleep well without me?

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:44.596
You're finally back.

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:46.932
Let me, as your roommate, make up for it.
